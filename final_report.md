#Information problem 
Trying to see each letter grade students got for courses in order to make a decesion 
on which section to register for 

#Target Browsers 
UMD students are the main users since this data applies specfically to them 

#Chosen Data to Work With 
I chose planet terp since it is one of the most used resources for student grade input by university of maryland students and allows for easy access to their data. 

#Chosen Stragety 
Chose to focus on just grade data per course and present the data in a table so its easy to follow and compare 

#How/if system helps to address the problem
It addresses the problem by gathering all the data in one place and making it easy to visualize. 


#Challenges faced and impact on final design
Organizing the data and making it presentable for users to read. 

#Possible future work directions with this problem
Allowing users to search professers or spefic sections of courses instead of allowing just a general search
